Hypothesis of this work: 
There is a correlation between a countryâ€™s coordinates and its level of wealth. 
Transparency is correlated with a country's wealth.
Resources for this work: 
Databases from the World Bank and World Transparency and data obtained through Google Maps API.

Data exploration process:
- Datasets exploration and download (religion, gdp, income group, region).
- Data cleaning to make sure there were no missing values and that such values were in a uniform format.
- Data merge into one single dataset through the common value, the country.
- Data frame creation combining columns in order to find noteworthy insights.
- Through the Google API, obtained Latitude and Longitude for each country in the data set.

Data analyisis:
- Several plotting trials in order to find those plots whose information provided an easier chance to display in an understandable way.

Conclusion:
- A country's coordinates do affect its level of wealth and its level of wealth is linked to its level of transparency, proven by:
    - The most distant countries from the Ecuador are the richest. 
    - The closest ones are the poorest.
    - The most transparent countries are the ones with the biggest GDPs.
    - The least transparent are the ones with the smallest GDPs.
    - The colder countries (hence the most distant from the Ecuador) are the most transparent ones.
    - The hotter countries (hence the closest to the Ecuador) are the least transparent ones.
